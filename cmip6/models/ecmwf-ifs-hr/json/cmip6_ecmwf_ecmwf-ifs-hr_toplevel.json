                "Radiative forcings follow CMIP6 recommendations.  Greenhouse gas concentrations of CO2, CH4, N2O, and CFC12 are explicitly prescribed and the combined effect of other greenhouse gas species is included as an effective concentration of CFC11. Time-varying historical ozone concentrations are specified using monthly three-dimensional ozone distributions. Solar forcing is applied as annual means of total solar irradiance. Tropospheric aerosol forcing is specified using version 2 of the Max-Plank Institute Aerosol Climatology Simple Plume model (MACv2-SP). Volcanic forcing is specified as a total stratospheric aerosol optical depth (SAOD) that varies with time and latitude. SAOD is derived from an offline vertical integration of extinction coefficients at 550 nm from a simplified version of the CMIP6 stratospheric aerosol data set. "
