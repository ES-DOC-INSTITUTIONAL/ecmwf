Greenhouse gas concentrations of CO2, CH4, N2O, and CFC12 are explicitly prescribed and the combined effect of other greenhouse gas species is included as an effective concentration of CFC11. Time-varying historical ozone concentrations are specified using monthly three-dimensional ozone distributions. Solar forcing is applied as annual means of total solar irradiance. Tropospheric aerosol forcing is specified using version 2 of the Max-Plank Institute Aerosol Climatology Simple Plume model (MACv2-SP). Volcanic forcing is specified as a total stratospheric aerosol optical depth (SAOD) that varies with time and latitude. SAOD is derived from an offline vertical integration of extinction coefficients at 550 nm from a simplified version of the CMIP6 stratospheric aerosol data set.
