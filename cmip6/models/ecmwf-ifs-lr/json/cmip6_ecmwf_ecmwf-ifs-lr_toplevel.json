                "ECMWF-IFS is a global Earth system model that includes dynamic representations of the atmosphere, sea-ice, ocean, land surface, and ocean waves. The CMIP6/HighResMIP version of ECMWF-IFS is derived from IFS cycle 43r1 that was implemented operationally at ECMWF in November 2016. The atmosphere component of ECMWF-IFS is based on a hydrostatic, semi-implicit, semi-Lagrangian dynamical core that utilizes the spectral transform method to alternate between between spectral and grid-point representations each time-step.  The vertical discretization is a hybrid sigma-pressure coordinate with 91 levels extending to 0.01 hPa. Advection and parameterized processes are calculated in grid-point space on a cubic octahedral reduced Gaussian (Tco) grid, which is defined such that the shortest wavelengths in spectral space are represented by 4 model grid points. The land surface is represented by the 4-layer HTESSEL model and the ocean-wave model is based on an updated version of WAM.  The ocean-sea-ice system is represented by version 3.4 of the Nucleus for European Models of the Ocean (NEMO) and version 2 of the Louvain-la-Neuve Sea-Ice Model (LIM2)."

Greenhouse gas concentrations of CO2, CH4, N2O, and CFC12 are explicitly prescribed and the combined effect of other greenhouse gas species is included as an effective concentration of CFC11. Time-varying historical ozone concentrations are specified using monthly three-dimensional ozone distributions. Solar forcing is applied as annual means of total solar irradiance. Tropospheric aerosol forcing is specified using version 2 of the Max-Plank Institute Aerosol Climatology Simple Plume model (MACv2-SP). Volcanic forcing is specified as a total stratospheric aerosol optical depth (SAOD) that varies with time and latitude. SAOD is derived from an offline vertical integration of extinction coefficients at 550 nm from a simplified version of the CMIP6 stratospheric aerosol data set. "
